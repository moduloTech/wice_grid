    A grid can export itself in the form of a XLSX file. The contents of the file corresponds to the selected subset of all records,
    that is, the XLSX export follows the state of filters and sorting.
  %p
    To enable XLSX export for a grid please do the following:
    %ol
      %li Make sure that the grid helper is in its own partial and there are no other elements in that partial including whitespaces
      %li
        Enable XLSX export by adding
        %code enable_export_to_xlsx:  true
        to
        %code initialize_grid
      %li
        Set the name of the exported file using option
        %code :xlsx_file_name
        in
        %code initialize_grid
      %li
        The action code should be finished by a call to
        %code export_grid_if_requested
        \:
        :plain
          <pre>
          export_grid_if_requested('g1' => 'tasks_grid', 'g2' => 'projects_grid') do
            # usual render or redirect code executed if the request is not a XLSX export request
          end
          </pre>
        The block is executed if the call is not a request for a XLSX file, so place your usual
        %code redirect_to
        ,
        %code render
        inside the block, or just skip it if your action does not have an explicit render:
        :plain
          <pre>
          export_grid_if_requested('g1' => 'tasks_grid', 'g2' => 'projects_grid')
          </pre>

        The keys of the hash submitted as an argument to
        %code  export_grid_if_requested
        are names of grids, and the values are names of partials where the grids are defined.

      %li
        If a column definition contains markup, first disable its export to XLSX adding
        %code in_xlsx: false
        to the column definition, and then duplicate the column definition without the markup in the block while adding
        %code in_html: false
        to the column definition. Any filter related parameters like
        %code :attribute
        ,
        %code :assoc
        , or
        %code :custom_filter
        can be skipped in a XLSX-only column.
      %li
        If you need an external XLSX export button , add  class
        %code wg-external-xlsx-export-button
        to any clickable element on page
        and set its attribute
        %code data-grid-name
        to the name of the grid. If you need to disable the default export icon in the grid, add
        %code hide_xlsx_button: true
        to the
        %code grid
        helper.
